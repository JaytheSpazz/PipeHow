When I started writing PowerShell I quickly realized that there are several ways to create collections of items and they all have different uses and behaviors. PowerShell will automatically create an array for you if something returns several results, but sometimes you need to create an array, arraylist or list manually. What are the differences, use cases and how do they work?

- Compare performance

- Mention LINQ and IEnumerable
